<!--                    DESIGN COMMENT                             -->
<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--                    This DTD Suite has been designed with Unicode
                        as the basic representation of all special
                        characters. The use of combining characters 
                        is supported and encouraged as is the use
                        of entities defined by the STIX project
                        (http://www.ams.org/STIX/). Unicode values
                        in planes other than Plane 0 may be freely
                        used.
                        
                        Use of private publisher entities and Unicode
                        Private Use Area is discouraged, but supported
                        with the <private-char> element, for which a
                        corresponding bitmap must be submitted.
                        
                        In cases where an entity name has been generally
                        accepted with a corresponding Unicode number
                        and the entity has not been added to
                        the ISO standard entity sets, a named entity
                        may be defined below (e.g. &euro;).
                        
                        Because of the potential for conflicts in
                        assignments by different publishers,
                        the Archival and Interchange DTD Suite does 
                        not support assignment of values in the
                        Unicode Private Use Area.
                        Publishers who have defined characters in the
                        Private Use Area must remap those characters
                        to existing Unicode values (using combining
                        characters for special accented characters
                        where appropriate), or must submit bitmaps of
                        those characters using one of the two methods
                        supported under the <private-char> element.
                        
                        Those custom publisher entities for which 
                        corresponding Unicode values have not been 
                        determined must be tagged with the 
                        <private-char> element. Publishers must submit 
                        bitmaps of those characters using one of the 
                        two methods supported in the <private-char> 
                        element.                                   -->

<!--                    For each of the following entities a name

                        could be determined, that character was used.

                        Area may not be deposited as is. If they
                        cannot be remapped to existing Unicode values,
                        they must be submitted as a bitmap using
                        the <private-char> element. The most 
                        repository-friendly technique is <glyph-data> 
                        although individual bitmap files may be 
                        submitted with inline-graphic.

                        We would like to thank Beacon Publishing and
                        the APS (American Physical Society) for 
                        providing us with this technique.          -->


<!--                    PRIVATE CHARACTER (CUSTOM OR UNICODE)      -->
<!--                    A custom character entity defined by a
                        publisher or a custom character from the
                        Unicode private-use area for which a bitmap
                        is submitted for the glyph.

                        Since there are no completely standard/public
                        agreements on how such characters are to be
                        named and displayed, this technique is to be
                        used instead of a custom general entity 
                        reference, to provide complete information 
                        on the intended character.
                        A document should contain a <private-char> 
                        element at each location where a private 
                        character is used within the document. The 
                        corresponding image for the glyph may be 
                        given in the <glyph-data> element or as an 
                        external bitmap file referenced by an 
                        <inline-graphic> element.

                        Implementation Note: <inline-graphic> should
                        only be used outside <private-char> when the
                        graphic is something other than a special
                        character.

                        character. The <glyph-data> element can be
                        used to provide information on the actual
                        glyph that is associated with the private-use
                        character. The element includes an inline
                        bitmap of the glyph encoded in plain
                        PBM (Plain Bit Map) format so that it is
                        human-readable.
