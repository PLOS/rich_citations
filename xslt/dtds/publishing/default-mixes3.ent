     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
     
     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite 
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov. 

     Details on version 3.0 are available at 
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

                        Inline elements appear only inside a

                        paragraph or at the same level as a 
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a 
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material 
                        will have restricted such elements to only

                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->
