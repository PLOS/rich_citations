     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite 
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

<!--                    Design Note: HISTORICAL ANNOTATIONS        -->
<!-- ============================================================= -->

<!--                    For the purposes of this DTD, annotations of 
                        historical material are considered to be of
                        two types: those with content, that is, those 
                        which add words to the text (for example, a
                        penciled marginal note) and those that merely
                        decorate words already in the text, for 
                        example, a phrase underlined in pencil.
                          Text-bearing annotations, whether inline
                        or block-level, use the <annotation> or the
                        <alt-text> elements. Decorations use the
                        <named-content> element with the attribute
                        "content-type" taking values like "underline"
                        and "yellow highlighter".
                           The <annotation> and <named-content>
                        elements are not defined in this module, since
                        they were already part of the NLM Archiving 
                        and Interchange DTD Suite when this DTD was
                        was written. No changes were needed to the
                        <named-content> element except that it is
                        allowed in a few more places through the
                        modification of the %phrase.class; and
                        %emphasis.class; Parameter Entities.
                           In the Suite, however, the <annotation>
                        element is only used within citations. In 
                        this DTD, it is a block-level element at the 
                        same level as a paragraph (%para-level;) as 
                        well as an inline-element inside textual 
                        passages (%emphasis.class;). New attributes 
                        were  added to <annotation> to describe some 
                        of these new roles/purposes.               -->

                        a typical behavior for this element would be
                        to cause the display of a horizontal rule and

                        printed, hand-written, perfed, etc., and 
                        there may be more than one number per page.

                           Another use for <alt-term> is to complete
